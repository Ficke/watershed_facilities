# Watershed Facilities: Smart Doc Upload MVP

A prototype implementation of Watershed's Smart Doc Upload feature for streamlined utility bill processing and Scope 2 emissions management.

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates the MVP outlined in the Watershed Facilities PRD - a system that automatically extracts and validates utility bill data, reducing manual entry from multiple days to under 30 minutes while maintaining audit-quality accuracy.

### The Problem We're Solving

Building Operators (retail chains, banks, real estate firms, healthcare systems) struggle with Scope 2 emissions management due to:
- **Highly distributed data**: Utility bills come as PDFs from multiple providers
- **Poor data quality**: Manual entry is error-prone and hard to verify
- **Lack of actionability**: Without clean data, sustainability teams can't identify reduction opportunities
- **Competitive pressure**: Bundled solutions from utility management companies are winning customers

### Our Solution: Smart Doc Upload

The MVP enables facilities managers to:
1. **Upload mixed utility bill formats** via familiar drag-and-drop interface
2. **Automatic data extraction** with confidence scoring and validation
3. **Focused validation** - review only uncertain fields with document context
4. **Immediate insights** - data flows directly into footprint analysis platform

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Upload Flow
- **Multi-format document upload** with drag-and-drop interface
- **Batch processing** with progress indicators
- **Smart validation workflow** flagging uncertain extractions
- **Upload results summary** showing processed vs. review-needed files

### âœ… Modern B2B UX
- **Consistent navigation** with proper back button flow
- **Fixed header/footer system** preventing layout shifts
- **Professional styling** following enterprise design patterns
- **Responsive layout** optimized for desktop workflow

### âœ… Integration Ready
- **Dataset organization** matching Watershed's measurement categories
- **Footprint dashboard** showing emissions analysis and breakdowns
- **Task management** system for tracking processing status

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ficke/watershed_facilities.git
   cd watershed_facilities_prototype
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`**

### Usage

1. **Navigate to Utilities**: Click "Upload Utilities" in the task list
2. **Upload Bills**: Drag and drop utility bill PDFs or click to browse
3. **Review Results**: See which files processed successfully vs. need review
4. **Validate Data**: For flagged files, confirm extracted values
5. **View Insights**: Data flows into the carbon footprint dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Built With
- **React 18** - Modern component architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling for rapid development
- **Lucide React** - Professional icon library
- **Vite** - Fast development build tool

### Key Components
- `App.jsx` - Main application with unified header/footer system
- `components/components.jsx` - All UI components in single file
- `mockData.js` - Sample data matching Watershed's data model

### Design Patterns
- **Unified Layout System** - Single source of truth for headers/footers
- **State-driven Navigation** - Centralized view management
- **Component Composition** - Reusable UI patterns
- **Responsive Design** - Desktop-first B2B workflow optimization

## Prototype Scope

### âœ… Implemented (MVP)
- Smart document upload interface
- Processing workflow with validation
- Upload results with success/review categorization
- Footprint dashboard with emissions breakdown
- Professional B2B styling and navigation

### ðŸš§ Future Milestones (Per PRD)
- **M1**: Intelligent validation with anomaly detection
- **M2**: Direct utility provider integrations
- **M3**: Real-time IoT monitoring capabilities

## Success Metrics (Target)

Based on the PRD, this MVP aims to achieve:
- **Customer Growth**: 75 â†’ 130 Building Operator customers (73% growth)
- **Churn Reduction**: 28% â†’ 18% within 6 months
- **Time Savings**: 2-3 days â†’ <30 minutes for monthly utility processing
- **NPS Improvement**: 45% â†’ 65% promoters for Scope 2 workflow

## Contributing

This is a prototype implementation. For production development:
1. Follow Watershed's engineering standards
2. Implement actual OCR/ML extraction pipeline
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Integrate with existing Watershed platform APIs
5. Add proper authentication and security measures
